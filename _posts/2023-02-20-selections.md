### What is the selection operation?
The selection operational in relational algebra is a unary operator that selects (for lack of better terms) attributes from a relation that meets specified criteria. 

It is a pretty straightforward operation, but to put it in readable English: selection is essentially an operation that picks certain rows within a database.

### How is Selection represented in relational algebra?
Selection is often denoted with the Greek letter sigma (𝜎). Here’s an example of selection being written in relational algebra:
- 𝜎ₗ(R)
  - where 𝜎 is obviously the predicate (or the operation)
  - l is the logic being performed
  - R is the relation/the name of the table.

So... if we wanted to apply this format to a real-life example, we could!
- 𝜎ₛₜᵤₙᵤₘ₌₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉(ONU)
  - This operation would select all of the rows within the ONU table that have the stuNum (student number) equal to 0123456789.

### So, what does this look like applied?
I’m still confused, do you have resources that might help me understand?
Sure, I do! Here are some of the resources that I used in research for this blog,
